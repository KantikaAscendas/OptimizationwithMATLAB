# Why do we do optimization
-  Make better decision 
-  Reduce costs 
-  Improve performance 
-  Maximize efficiency 
<a id="H_4ef7"></a>

# Challenges
-  Involve complex mathematics 
-  Require extensive programming 
<a id="H_2257"></a>

# Proposed Solution
-  Low\-code approach that can solve wide range of optimization problems with minimal coding
